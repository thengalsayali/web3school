        <h1>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h1>
        <p>CSS represents the design for a web page. But when you are learning this information for the first time, it
            can be hard to keep track of all of the different CSS properties.</p>
        <p>In this article, I have created a study guide for the freeCodeCamp curriculum's entire Learn Basic CSS by
            Building a Cafe Menu practice project. This study guide is filled with additional information, articles, and
            videos to help you understand the concepts better.</p>
        <h3>DOCTYPE and HTML elements</h3>
        <p>The first line in your HTML code should be the DOCTYPE declaration. A DOCTYPE tells the browser what version
            of HTML the page is written in.</p>
        <p>This is the DOCTYPE declaration for HTML 5:</p>
        <pre>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</pre>
        <h3>Head and Title elements</h3>
        <p>The &lt;head&gt; tags contain information that is processed by machines. Inside the &lt;head&gt; tags, you
            will nest metadata which is data that describes the document to the machine.</p>
        <h4>Meta charset attribute</h4>
        <p>UTF-8 is the standard character encoding you should use in your web pages. This will usually be the first
            &lt;meta&gt; tag shown in the &lt;head&gt; element.</p>
        <h3>Body element</h3>
        <p>The body element contains all of the content for the web page. This includes headings, paragraphs, images,
            links, and more.</p>
