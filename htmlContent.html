        <h1>HTML: The Backbone of the Web</h1>
        <p>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is a markup language for the web that defines the structure of web pages.</p>
        <p>It is one of the most basic building blocks of every website, so it's crucial to learn if you want to have a career in web development.</p>
        <p>In this article, I will walk you through what HTML is about in detail, how it does things on web pages, and we'll also touch on a really cool part of HTML – Semantic HTML.</p>
        <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
        <p>To understand "HTML" from front to back, let's look at each word that makes up the abbreviation:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Hypertext:</strong> text (often with embeds such as images, too) that is organized in order to connect related items</li>
            <li><strong>Markup:</strong> a style guide for typesetting anything to be printed in hardcopy or soft copy format</li>
            <li><strong>Language:</strong> a language that a computer system understands and uses to interpret commands</li>
        </ul>
        <p>HTML determines the structure of web pages. This structure alone is not enough to make a web page look good and interactive. So you'll use assisted technologies such as CSS and JavaScript to make your HTML beautiful and add interactivity, respectively.</p>
        <p>In this case, I like to break down the three technologies – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – this way: they are like a human body.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML is the skeleton,</li>
            <li>CSS is the skin,</li>
            <li>JavaScript is the circulatory, digestive, and respiratory systems that bring the structure and the skin to life.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>You can also look at HTML, CSS, and JavaScript this way: HTML is the structure of a house, CSS is the interior and exterior decor, and JavaScript is the electricity, water system, and many other functional features that make the house livable.</p>
