        <h1>Introduction to PHP</h1>
        <p>PHP is an incredibly popular programming language.</p>
        <p>Statistics say it’s used by 80% of all websites. It’s the language that powers WordPress, the widely used content management system for websites.</p>
        <p>And it also powers a lot of different frameworks that make Web Development easier, like Laravel. Speaking of Laravel, it may be one of the most compelling reasons to learn PHP these days.</p>
        <h3>Why Learn PHP?</h3>
        <p>PHP is quite a polarizing language. Some people love it, and some people hate it. If we move a step above the emotions and look at the language as a tool, PHP has a lot to offer.</p>
        <h3>Introduction to PHP</h3>
        <p>PHP is a programming language that many devs use to create Web Applications, among other things.</p>
        <p>As a language, it had a humble beginning. It was first created in 1994 by Rasmus Lerdorf to build his personal website. He didn’t know at the time it would eventually become one of the most popular programming languages in the world. It became popular later on, in 1997/8, and exploded in the 2000s when PHP 4 landed.</p>
        <p>You can use PHP to add a little interactivity to an HTML page.</p>
        <p>Or you can use it as a Web Application engine that creates HTML pages dynamically and sends them to the browser.</p>
        <p>It can scale to millions of page views.</p>
        <p>Did you know Facebook is powered by PHP? Ever heard of Wikipedia? Slack? Etsy?</p>
